# elm
Used to practice with the elm language

## Notes
Most of the work in here is isolated into lower directories.
For example, practice contains work in a bunch of subdirectories.
Each of these subdirectories is meant to be self contained in order to allow
me to explore different spaces in elm without having a ton of different
repositories.

As I create useful things, I do try to break them out into their own packages.
For example, I created an API for a [Multiway Tree Zipper](https://github.com/tomjkidd/elm-multiway-tree-zipper)

practice/tree-work is probably the most significant work to date, because
it was where I have been holding the development of a Tree UI control while I
work out the kinks.
