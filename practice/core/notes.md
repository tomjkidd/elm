    elm-make ElmFile.elm --output=Main.html
While reading about [Interop](http://elm-lang.org/guide/interop), I found this command that makes life easier by allowing you to compile and dump your elm code to an Html file, which you can then run with a simple web server.

    elm repl
This command allows you to have a command line session with elm.
